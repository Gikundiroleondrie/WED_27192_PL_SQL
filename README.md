## ðŸ“Œ ELECTRICITY BILL DATABASE SYSTEM ##


## ðŸ”‘ Problem Statement
The current manual system for managing electricity billing is inefficient and prone to errors, leading to delays in bill generation, inaccurate customer records, and difficulties in tracking payments. There is a need for a comprehensive Electricity Bill Database System that can streamline the entire billing processâ€”from customer registration and meter reading to bill generation and payment recording. This system should ensure accurate data management, improve payment tracking, and provide timely reports to support effective decision-making by the utility company.
